            <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="project__tldr">
                While we all shared design responosibilies, I was tasked mainly with the design portion of the project: paper prototpying, wireframes, as well as hi-fi prototyping. Roshan and Edward also focussed on designing the paper prototypes and hi-fi prototypes as well as handling the extensive user researching, user testing as well as documentation.

                Project Objective
            </h2>

            <p>
                In designing a new feature for LinkedIn, we hope to help people rekindle old connections, strengthen existing connections, and discover new connections.
            </p>

            <h2>Users and Goals</h2>

            <p>
                We’ve decided to focus on attendees of professional conferences, networking events, and recruiting events as our target audience.

                Users (event attendees) should be able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>check-in as attending a certain professional conference or networking event
                    </li>
                    <li>find out which connections or friends are also attending</li>
                    <li>engage with and set up in-person meetings and hangouts at the event</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Why this idea?</h2>

            <p>
                We all go to a lot of professional and networking events, and sometimes don’t know about the attendees. You might miss out on meeting your friends and old connections just because you didn’t know they were attending. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that networking isn’t about just establishing new connections, but also about building on your existing ones. This is the reason we wanted to create an events feature right inside LInkedIn, because it offers a great platform to build on your old connections.
            </p>

            <h2>Research Goals</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Understand how people sustain relationships with LinkedIn connections
                </li>
                <li>Discover how people interact with previous and new connections at conferences
                </li>
                <li>Understand how recruiters utilize LinkedIn before and during conferences
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Interviews</h2>

            <p>
                We conducted two one-on-one interviews. The first was with Faby Zuñiga, a university recruiter at Microsoft, who attends several conferences per year as a recruiter representing Microsoft. The second was with Jennifer Zheng, a software engineer at LinkedIn who also attends several conferences per year, both to represent LinkedIn and to learn more about the technology industry community.
            </p>

            <h2>Research Findings</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>89%</strong>
                    of LinkedIn users connect with different people on LinkedIn than they connect with on other social media
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>90%</strong>
                    of conference attendees don’t know which of their LinkedIn connections will also be there
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>33%</strong>
                    of conference attendees focus more than half of their time on re-connecting with previous friends/connections
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Core Pain Points</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Conference and event attendees don’t know which of their connections are attending.</li>
                <li>Company recruiters struggle to source conference attendees, and verify them as attending.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Key Interview Takeaways</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft recruiters have trouble knowing who is verified as attending a conference prior to start. Recruiters source people before a conference so they can do on-sites at the conference. Last conference attended was for NSBE.</li>
                <li>Very familiar with LinkedIn’s functionality. Finds out who’s attending conferences through word of mouth and news feeds. Values serendipitous meetings and organic relationship development at conferences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Workflows</h2>

            <h3>Attendee Workflow</h3>
            <p>
                The Attendee Workflow has an entry point from the LinkedIn user’s Home page, which shows the newsfeed, trending hashtags, and events. The Home page is the natural starting point because this feature is a discovery feature, and most discovery happens from the Home page.

                The attendee workflow is designed for attendees of conferences and professional events, who want to know which connections are attending the same event, and what new connections can they find. Through this workflow, they can both find new connections from attendees, and view which of their connections are attending. Hence, they can schedule in-person meetings.
            </p>

            <h3>Recruiter Workflow</h3>
            <p>
                The Recruiter Workflow also has an entry point from the Recruiter’s LinkedIn Home page. The Home page contains information about imminent events on LinkedIn, so it is a natural entry point to see more information about the event.

                The recruiter workflow is designed for company recruiters who attend conferences to find potential candidates. Through the workflow, the recruiter can see who in their network is guaranteed to be at the conference, and also discover new candidates who will also be at the conference. Furthermore, they can filter and segment people at the event in order to find LinkedIn users that would be a great fit for their firm. Through the workflow, they can discover who will be at the conference, and utilize LinkedIn’s other features to schedule in-person meetings at the conference.
            </p>

            <h2>User Testing</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Matt preferred Flow A because he thought it was clearer. He didn’t find use in having the demographics analysis be dropdown menus in Flow B.</li>
                <li>Zhentao preferred Flow A because he found the use of filters and the ability to add people to groups very intuitive.</li>
                <li>Miranda preferred Flow A because she thought it was simple and clear. She thought Flow B was too cluttered and overwhelming. She stated that she “didn’t understand the cognitive model behind the design of Flow B.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Flow A and Flow B</h2>

            <p>Flow A focuses more on groups that the person or recruiter can create, and the flow from viewing a conference or event to creating a group. Flow B focuses more on event demographics and connecting with individual attendees. Our goal is to establish which features our target audience finds most useful, and which design they understand the best.
            </p>

			</figure>

            <p>
                <em>We will move forwards with Flow A because users found it simple and clear. The ability to create groups is key to having LinkedIn users interact with those groups in person, so we have decided to take into considerations that users enjoyed the Groups feature of Flow A. However, we will change the following:</em>
            </p>

            <h2>Final User Testing</h2>

            <p>
                Caroline, Chris, and Miranda all praised the aesthetic and colorful design of our feature. With the buttons and icons that we designed, they felt as though they were using the real LinkedIn app. Furthermore, they easily interacted with the group (setting filters and messaging group members). All three liked the tile layout of both alternate screens better, and found it more eye-catching and simple to use.

                Caroline, Chris, and Miranda all stated that the navigation was confusing. Specifically, they found the flow for adding attendees to a group unintuitive. They weren’t sure how to select people for a group and how the message icon helped to add people to a group. Additionally, the congratulatory message prevented them from seeing the group that they just created; they were expecting to see the new group immediately after creating it.

            </p>

            <h2>
                Reflection
            </h2>

            <p>
                Working on this project has given me a lot of insight about how to design <em>inside</em> an existing design system. Before this, I've almost exclusively worked on design systems created by scratch, and mostly by myself. This project also helped me learn about sharing responsibities and the elusive skill that is teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think moving forward, we can focus on how to intergate this <strong>events</strong> flow with existing events and provide a platform for partnerships to event organizers, career fairs and companies.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can also move forward with a whole flow dedicated to making the career fair experience much simpler and integrated for both recruiters and job applicants. Mianly because the experience is pretty broken and incoherent right now, and with our base flow, I think we can integrate it in a cohesive fashion.
            </p>
